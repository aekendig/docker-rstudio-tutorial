The specifications include the versions of RStudio and two packages. This tutorial is aimed at new users of Docker. Prior experience with Rstudio is helpful, but  not required. You will need to download and install RStudio at https://rstudio.com/ and Docker Desktop at https://www.docker.com/. In the process, you should create a Docker Hub login.
