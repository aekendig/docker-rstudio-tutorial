# Reproducible Data Analysis with Docker and RStudio

Docker and RStudio are two tools that can be used to increase the reproducibility of your data analysis. Such tools can make it easier for collaborators, other scientists, and "future you" to re-run statistics and create visualizations. This tutorial provides a very simple example of "containerizing" an R script and packages. There are certainly cases in which this example will fail to reproduce the data analysis. Reproducibility is a complex problem that requires continuous effort.  
 
To access the tutorial, go to [tutorial-instructions.md](https://github.com/aekendig/docker-rstudio-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-instructions.md).  In this tutorial, you will:  
1. Run a simple data analysis locally  
2. Run a template Docker container  
3. Build upon the template Docker container to create your own  

PDF documents provide more background and details (presentations for the Flory Lab at UF and R-Ladies Gainesville).
